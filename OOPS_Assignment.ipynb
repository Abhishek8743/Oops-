        "1.  **Method Overriding:** A subclass can provide its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. When you call that method on an object of the subclass, the subclass's version is executed.\n",
        "2.  **Common Interface:** If multiple subclasses inherit from a common superclass and override the same method, they all share a common method signature. This allows you to write code that can call this method on any object of these subclasses without needing to know the specific type of the object at compile time.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, if you have a `Animal` superclass with a `speak()` method, and subclasses like `Dog` and `Cat` that override `speak()` to produce different sounds, you can have a list of `Animal` objects (which might contain `Dog` and `Cat` instances). When you iterate through the list and call `speak()` on each object, the appropriate `speak()` method (from `Dog` or `Cat`) will be called dynamically based on the actual type of the object. This demonstrates polymorphism in action – the same method call (`speak()`) behaves differently depending on the object it's called on."
